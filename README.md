## Architectural desitions

### NX mono-repo setup
I choose a mono-repo setup because it:
- Shared code and visibility - Keeps your code DRY across your entire organization. Reuse validation code, UI components, and types across the codebase. Reuse code between the backend, the frontend, and utility libraries.

- Atomic changes - Change a server API and modify the downstream applications that consume that API in the same commit. You can change a button component in a shared library and the applications that use that component in the same commit. A monorepo saves the pain of trying to coordinate commits across multiple repositories.

- Developer mobility - Get a consistent way of building and testing applications written using different tools and technologies. Developers can confidently contribute to other teams’ applications and verify that their changes are safe.

- Single set of dependencies - Use a single version of all third-party dependencies, reducing inconsistencies between applications. Less actively developed applications are still kept up-to-date with the latest version of a framework, library, or build tool.
